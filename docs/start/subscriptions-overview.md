Overwolf ads are low-interruption and forgivable, showing up in appropriate times to avoid bothering gamers as they play. However, some gamers still prefer to have no ad experiences visible at all when using apps and playing games. Towards that end, and to increase app creator revenues, we set up a new tool in your monetization arsenal - app subscription. 

Users are now able to purchase subscription time and become premium users of your app, getting special perks and services in return beyond removing ads. We encourage you to think of cool ways to reward premium users and improve their experience beyond removing ads- the better the features you can come up with, the more will your subscription base grow.

Subscriptions provide you with more than a stable source of income, it brings your users closer to you and increases their engagement with your project - they are backing you so you can keep developing, please remember to show them some love!

## Subscription Basics

A complete user flow can be found [here](subscriptions-flow).  

Detailed instructions on how to implement subscriptions in your own app can be found [here](subscriptions-integration).

Any application can launch a subscription program based on removing ads, but we strongly recommend developing new perks and benefits for Premium users to ensure paying customers will feel like they got good value for their investment.

## Who can sub?

Any of your users with a Paypal account or international credit card can subscribe to your app.
